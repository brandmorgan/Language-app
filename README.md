# App name-"Language-App"

## An application for people interested in coding to decide which language they should learn first.

Tech used:

- HTML
- CSS
- JS

## Description:

An application that uses a survey with data imput, that will guide a new programmer to use the best language suited for them.

## Setup/Installation

## Known bugs:

A lot.
There has not yet been enough data imput to gather results to run the JS properly. Actively working on de-bugging.

## Objective list

- Week 2 resubmission
- Form gathers input from the user.
- Branching is used to determine the result.
- Web API object properties or methods (not including window methods for alerting, prompting, or confirming) are used to display the result to the user.
- Event handler properties or event listeners are used to handle events.
- When the user submits the form again (for a second or third time) previous results are hidden, cleared, or replaced.
- Variable names are descriptive of what they represent and use lower camel case (e.g. myVariableExample).
- Web page is styled using custom CSS.
- Project is in a polished, portfolio-quality state.
- The promptâ€™s required functionality and baseline project requirements are in place by the deadline.
